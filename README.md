# tic-tac-toe

**General Info**

Ahh, the infamous tic-tac-toe project. At the genesis of my coding journey, I would freeze up at the thought of where to even begin building something like this but after having tackled it, I can honestly say that it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought. I assumed that the most challenging part would be the JS portion but I found the CSS portion to be more of a test because I decided to create my Xs and Os with CSS instead of hardcoding them into my HTML in order to sharpen my CSS skills. Using 'transform', I was able to accomplish this seamlessly after lots of trial and error and of course googling. 

With Javascript, being that I played countless games of tic-tac-toe as a kid (and won lol), I knew what logic needed to be used in order to get this project working. With some planning before starting to code, I decided to use an array of arrays of possible scenarios in order to track the winner. I also planned to create functions that would handle things like swapping turns and actually starting the game. 

Overall, this project was a great learning experience and after having completed it, I can use my sharpened skills to tackle even more complex and challening ones.
